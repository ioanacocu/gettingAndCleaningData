The code merges all the data in a single table, then selects the columns that were required, and prints the resulting data in a text file "merged_data.txt".
Then the second data set is generated and saved in "final_data.txt".
The names of the variables have remained as they were in the features list, the only ones that have been added are "users" and "activities". The activities are no longer represented by a
code, but by their full name, as in the description.
The columns in the final datasets represent the means of the values in the initial data.
